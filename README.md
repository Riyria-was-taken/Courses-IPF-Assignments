# Courses-IPF-Assignments
Assignments from Introduction to Programming (Functional approach), MIM UW, year 1.

For each task we have to implement the module in OCaml language (suiting to the .mli file) and make some test to check
the corectness of our code. Then our solution is checked by the other coursant, so we get the info about some errors
or non-optimal or ugly implementation. So we do for another person.

In the nearest future I'm going to translate my solutions into English, add task descriptions and develop this repository.
Soo stay tuned ^~^.
